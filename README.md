# Exam Paper Checking System

This project is a web-based AI application for automatically evaluating student answer sheets. It allows students to upload scanned images of handwritten answers and provides automated scoring based on similarity to ideal answers.

## Features

- Upload scanned answer sheets
- Store answers in a SQLite database
- Score answers using AI-based similarity (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)
- Predefined ideal answers for comparison
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend built with FastAPI
- CORS-enabled for API interaction with frontend

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI/ML**: Transformers (commented), TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
- **Libraries**: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `torch`, `transformers`, `PIL`, `scikit-learn`

 AI Logic
Though currently commented for runtime safety, the app includes infrastructure to:

Extract text using a Transformer-based OCR

Match with ideal answers using TF-IDF vectorization

Score based on cosine similarity between student and ideal answers
